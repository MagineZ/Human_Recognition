## Human Recognition with OpenCV

The project is using OpenCV build-in libarary to ship a pre-trained HOG + Linear SVM model 
that can be used to perform pedestrian detection in both images and video streams. 
Main code is in the detect.py

## Histogram of Oriented Gradient

The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. 
The technique counts occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image.
